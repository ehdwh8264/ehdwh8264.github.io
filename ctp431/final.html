  <h2>20140377 Dongjo YOON</h2><br><br>
  <h3>1. Introduction </h3>
  <blockquote>
 Make and construct DJ Controller. it has function to mix two Music with gain some effectors. Each music can be modified for using many knobes. it has Equlizer, Scratcher, Reverb, Delay, Speed Controller and Crossfader. Crossfader can controll ratio of each music's volume to usefull mixing. Also, you can select music on SoundCloud at Top searching board!!. 

</blockquote><br><br>

<h3>2. Instruction DJ Controller </h3>
  <blockquote>
1. you can choose music on Searching Board or drop music files at Disk. then you can play music to turn on "Play button".<br><br>
2. adjust equalizer knobes and volume and music speed bar to make music style you wanted each music.<br><br>
3. also you can effect another effectors. it's placed lower position. "Scratcher", "Crush", "Reverb", "Delay" knobes. if you want to effect these function, you turn on "Power Botton". then you can controll them.<br><br>
4. after effecting, you can mix musics to use "Crossfader" bar. as gage of crossfader bar is located left side, volume ratio of left music has much louder. so, you can controll volume ratio. <br><br>
5. if you want stop one of these music, you can turn off each "Play button". Play enjoy your mixing DJ !!

</blockquote><br><br>

  <h3>3. Components  </h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>- Equalizer</h4>
 it has Trable, Mid and Bass Knobes. also it has Volume controll bar. Treble can adjust Music's high pitch sound level, so it's called "High" also. Mid and Bass can adjust middle pitch spund level and low pitch sound level. using these knobes, you can emphasize or de-emphasize pitches you want. high, middle, low pitch mean sound of high, middle, low frequency. and construct functions by using these frequency bands. 
<br><br>

<h4>- Scracher</h4>
this effector is component of Low Pass Filter and High Pass Filter. you can change these Cut-Off frequency to make effect. this effect change music style such like Wrinkle. so, it's called Scracher. Low Pass Filter can decrese high frequency sound level. it will make thick sound likes Robot Voice.


<br><br>


<h4>- Crush</h4>
this effector can make music to effect analog radio noise. Crush knob has lower, sound wave be
 crushed, then make noise. in this effector, we adjusts the bypass bit of sound. it cause of noise sound.

<br><br>


<h4>- Reverb</h4>
it can make music to blooming. this function be made by convolution between music and impulse response. in this DJ Controller uses "LargeLongEchoHall.wav" impulse response file. 

<br><br>

<h4>- Delay</h4>
it has two knobes, Time and Mix. Time value take period of Delay interval. Mix value take these sustainment time of delay. you can make Opera Hall sound like Echo sound to change these knobes. and this effect has fixed wetLevel and dryLevel. so this delay has fixed depth of delay.


<br><br>

<h4>- Speed Controller</h4>
change speed of music. it can change X2 ~ 0.13 rate. these value multipluse on rate of music and this defult value can be music speed. 


<br><br>

<h4>- Crossfader</h4>
it makes ratio of music volumes. "Crossfader" bar located at middle, ratio of music volume is 1:1, if you move this bar to left side, left side music takes much more louder and right side music takes lower volume.  


<br><br>


<h4>- Search Music on SoundCloud</h4>
music can be selected by SoundCloud Music Board. if you want search music on web site or you don't have music files, jest search files on searching board on top of DJ Controller. this links URL of SoundClound website.

</blockquote><br><br>


 <h3>4. Improvement Point</h3>
<blockquote>
I want to make to be able to watch these Music's sound wave leal time. like next picture. it can be more usefull to modify music in directly. i tried, however it was not working. if i has next chance to make this function, Visualization of DJing music, and make perfectly, i wish that.
